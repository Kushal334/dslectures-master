    "Natural language processing (NLP) concerns the part of Machine Learning about the analysis of digital, human written texts. The topic of NLP is as old as machine learning itself and dates back to Alan Turing himself. Since text is a widely used medium there are plenty of applications of machine learning:\n",

    "Especially in the past few years there has been exciting and rapid progress in the field. One example is the release of OpenAI's GPT-2, a language model able to not only create realistic text samples but also solve tasks of many NLP benchmarks without special training. See the figure below for an example output of GPT-2.\n",

    "Natural text is different to other data sources such as numerical tables or images. One way to look at text is to consider each word to be a feature. Since most languages have of the order of 100k words in their vocabulary plus many variations this leads to an enormous feature space. At the same time most words in the vocabulary do not appear in a small text. This leads to extreme sparsity. These properties call for a different approach to NLP than the methods we encountered and used for tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook overview\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to classify movie reviews in terms of positive or negative feedback. This task is called sentiment analysis and is a common NLP application. As a company you might use a sentiment classifier to analyse customer feedback or detect toxic comments on your website.\n",

    "Text data can be messy and require some clean up. The specific steps for the clean-up can depend on how the data was generated or where it was found. Text from the web might have some html artifacts that need cleaning or product reviews could include meta information on the review. Python offers powerful tools to manipulate strings. If cleaning requires complex rules one can also resort to regular expressions or regex for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the text is cleaned we have to encode it in a way that machine learning methods can handle. Directly using text representation as input is not possible. Most machine learning methods can only handle numerical data such as vectors and matrices. So we have to encode the input texts as vectors or matrices. These text representations are called vector encodings. Furthermore, we look at n-grams to keep some of the sequential structure of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can train a model to classify the movie review texts. However, the Random Forest models we already know well do not work well for the high-dimensional data. We introduce a new methods that is common for text data called the Naïve Bayes classifier that utilises Bayes theorem.\n",

      "I have just seen Today You Die. It is bad, almost very bad.<br /><br />1) The direction and editing are awful, just awful. Almost made me turn off the movie, Fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he is doing, he seems to be filming things at random and some scenes don't make sense at all. Also, I hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie, in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. Pretty bad.<br /><br />2) The dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes awful. I like the fact that they wanted to make Seagal's character and Treach's character seem like they were in a similar relationship to the characters in Lethal Weapon, but it did not work simply because some of the dialogue DID NOT MAKE SENSE, and I speak English very well, it's not that I did not understand the words, it was the fact that the jokes and dialogue lines had no meaning whatsoever.<br /><br />3) The script is pretty bad. Why do they always try to complicate DTV action movies? Seagal's wife in the movie has psychic abilities, why? Is it useful to the movie? NO. Seagal eliminates a whole bunch of people who work for the guy who betrayed him and he knows these people without having ever met them in the movie. STUPID. The story sometimes goes off track and the jumps back without any reason. The story is messy and pointless sometimes. They should have kept it simple and it would have worked.<br /><br />4) In some of the action scenes it is not Seagal, it is his stunt double. You can tell because they only film him from behind and never show his face. He also beats the guys with movie martial arts, not real ones like the aikido Steven knows. The stunt double uses cheesy kicks and punches.<br /><br />5) Steven is good in the movie. 90-95% of the lines are said with his real voice. The rest is dubbing but it is not that bad. This was good. Also Steven seems to be enjoying himself in the movie and is more into the action that he was in Submerged. He likes Treach as a partner; at least he does not seem to dislike him. Also, he seems to have been in better shape than in some of his recent movies. I hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body, but in the same clothes that he wears on the DVD cover he looks more than OK and he should have wore those clothes for most of the movie not the stupid long leather coat.<br /><br />I really think that Seagal was willing to make a good movie. The fact that he came late and took off early from the set ON TWO MOVIES directed by Fauntleroy does not look like a coincidence to me. I think he realized that the crew were amateurs or only in it for a quick buck and he did not give a damn anymore.<br /><br />In the hands of a better company and crew this might have been a damn good action movie for Seagal. Something like Out for Justice or Above the Law. I honestly believe that. But the people who made the movie are not very good at their jobs or they did not have enough money to do the job properly. Too bad since I liked Steven in the movie and Treach was cool (Ice Cool ) too, but the rest was bad. Hey, at least this gives me hope for Black Dawn and Shadows of the past. I think that Mercenary might be just as badly handled. But hey, Steven seemed to be back into the same mood he was in while making his better movies and at least THAT is reason enough to watch the movie.<br /><br />I liked it, but it could have been SO much better. 4/10\n",

      "Boring, long, pretentious, repetitive, self-involved  this move felt like a bad date. Worse, the tedious art-school direction -- with a heavy-handed use of the whirling shot that gets so overdone it almost made me throw up - is constantly screaming to be noticed. Add the thinnest of plots and virtually no dialogue, and the film begins to feel like a four hour epic about 30 minutes in. It gets worse: instead of dialogue there are poorly written voice-overs AND quotes and songs that comment all too obviously on the characters. Really loud opera music too. Blame it all on the director.<br /><br />The actors are all quite good. The lead actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suited for film stardom. He and the other actors have some tender erotic moments. Even these start to get boring after 5 minutes however, and one wonders if the director is auditioning for a Bel Ami porn job. The stunning college campus architecture as a location in Mexico City is inspiring. How come universities in the US are so bland (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD on this film.
